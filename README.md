`R/ncdfV4toV3.R` converts the CMORPH data to the proper .nc classic format. Currently, GitHub Actions run the script daily at 10am UTC. See the [Observable notebook](https://observablehq.com/@clayton-aldern/drought) for the live version of the globe.

For more information on the CMORPH SPI dataset, see [drought.gov](https://drought.gov/international). Thanks to [Chad Small](https://github.com/caksmall) for the assist!
